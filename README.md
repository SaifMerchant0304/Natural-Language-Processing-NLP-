### Natural-Language-Processing

- **Project Overview:**
  - The aim of this project is to develop two sequential NLP classifiers for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection.
  - The sentiment analysis model utilizes IMDB movie review data to classify customer sentiments as positive or negative.
  - The sarcasm detection model utilizes headlines from The Onion and The Huffington Post to identify sarcastic sentences.

- **Sentiment Analysis Model:**
  - **Data Description:**
    - Utilizes 50,000 IMDB movie reviews labeled as positive or negative sentiments.
    - Reviews are preprocessed and encoded as sequences of word indexes.
    - The vocabulary size is limited to 10,000, and only the first 20 words of each review are used.
  - **Tasks:**
    1. Import and analyze the dataset using `imdb.load_data()` method.
    2. Perform sequence padding on the data.
    3. Conduct data analysis, including printing the shape of features and labels.
    4. Decode feature values to retrieve original sentences.
    5. Design, train, tune, and test a sequential model for sentiment analysis.
    6. Use the model to predict sentiments on a sample review.

- **Sarcasm Detection Model:**
  - **Data Description:**
    - Collected from The Onion and The Huffington Post, providing high-quality labels with less noise.
    - Each record includes attributes such as whether the headline is sarcastic, the headline itself, and a link to the original article.
  - **Tasks:**
    1. Read and explore the dataset.
    2. Retain relevant columns for analysis.
    3. Calculate the length of each sentence.
    4. Define parameters for model training.
    5. Obtain indices for words in the headlines.
    6. Create features and labels for the sarcasm detection model.
    7. Determine the vocabulary size for the model.
    8. Generate a weight matrix using GloVe embeddings.
    9. Define and compile a LSTM model for sarcasm detection.
    10. Fit the model and evaluate validation accuracy.

- **Project Approach:**
  - Both models utilize deep learning techniques, including sequential models and LSTM layers.
  - The sentiment analysis model focuses on customer reviews from IMDB, while the sarcasm detection model analyzes news headlines.
  - Preprocessing steps such as sequence padding and word embedding are applied to both datasets.
  - Model performance is assessed using validation accuracy to ensure effective sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection.

- **Key Considerations:**
  - Experimentation and analysis are encouraged to optimize model performance.
  - The choice of parameters, word embeddings, and model architecture can significantly impact the accuracy of sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection.
  - Both models aim to provide valuable insights into customer sentiments and textual sarcasm, which are essential for understanding audience reactions and preferences in the digital content and entertainment industry.

- **Conclusion:**
  - By developing and fine-tuning sequential NLP classifiers, this project aims to enhance understanding and analysis of customer sentiments and textual sarcasm, contributing to improved decision-making and content creation strategies in the digital content and entertainment industry.
